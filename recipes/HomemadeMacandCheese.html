        <h1>Homemade Mac and Cheese</h1>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This classic baked mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb
            topping is creamy and comforting. It's easy to make the cheese sauce
            from scratch on your stovetop, starting with a roux and adding milk,
            Cheddar, and Parmesan, resulting in a rich, decadent sauce that
            coats every nook and cranny of the noodles. Serve this comfort-food
            macaroni and cheese casserole with grilled meats, sloppy Joes, fried
            chicken or alongside a salad for a meatless dinner.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredient</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>¼ cup salted butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups milk, or more as needed</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an
                8-inch square baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly
                salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring
                occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8
                minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer
                to the prepared baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium
                skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture
                becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and
                bring to a simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated
                Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir
                over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3
                to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed. Pour
                cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a
                skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until
                well coated and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and
                cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and
                macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
            </li>
